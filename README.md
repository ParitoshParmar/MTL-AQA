[What and How Well You Performed? A Multitask Learning Approach to Action Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04346)

## 🚀 Also Check Out Our New Approach! 🚀
**Oct 2024:** We have developed a new approach, [NeuroSymbolic AQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13798), that builds upon this approach, but also analyses and scores using **Professional Rules-based** programs. It is *Comprehensive* and *Explainable* AQA which can generate **Full Performance Reports** for *Actionable* Insights!!! We encourage you to checkout [[Code, Rules-based Programs, Dataset](https://github.com/laurenok24/NSAQA)] [[Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/X-NS/NSAQA)] [[Full Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13798)]

You are welcome to continue using this project, as it will still be maintained alongside the new approach!
